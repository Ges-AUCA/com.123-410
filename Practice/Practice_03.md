Computer Architecture, Practice #3
==================================

In this task, we will work with the stack to store local variables and send
arguments to functions.

## Problem #13: "Unsigned Locals"

Write an x86-64 assembly program that reads two **unsigned** numbers of type
`long` from the user and outputs their sum. The variables MUST be local to
function `main` and stored on the stack.

```bash
gcc -static -fno-pie -no-pie -o 13 13.x86-64.s
./13
10 20
10 + 20 = 30
```

Create the same program but in aarch64 assembly.

```bash
aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc -static -fno-pie -no-pie -o 13 13.aarch64.s
./13
10 20
10 + 20 = 30
```

Try to overflow the result. Compare the code with the one where variables
were stored in the global `.data` section.

## Problem #14: "Return Address"

Write an x86-64 assembly program that prints the return address of the `main`
function stored on the stack. Call the code directly to force the program to
exit with status 0. The exit status can be accessed in `bash` command
interpreter through the `$?` variable.

```bash
gcc -static -fno-pie -no-pie -o 14 14.x86-64.s
./14
0x7ffff7df30b3 # could be any other address
echo $?
0
```

Create the same program but in aarch64 assembly.

```bash
aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc -static -fno-pie -no-pie -o 14 14.x86-64.s
./14
0x9ffff4ac43f1 # could be any other address
echo $?
0
```

## Problem #15: "Arguments to Functions"

Recreate the following C program in x86-64 and aarch64 assembly manually. Note
that parameters are of type `int`, but the return types of functions are `long`.
Use sign-extension instructions of the target platform to do the C casts.

```C
#include <stdio.h>

static const char *output_format = "%ld\n";

static long add1(int a)
{
    return (long) a;
}

static long add2(int a, int b)
{
    return (long) a + (long) b;
}

static long add3(int a, int b, int c)
{
    return (long) a + (long) b + (long) c;
}

// TODO: add4, add5...

static long add10(int a, int b, int c, int d, int e, int f, int g, int h, int i, int j)
{
    return (long) a + (long) b + (long) c + (long) d + (long) e + (long) f + (long) g + (long) h + (long) i + (long) j;
}

int main(void)
{
    printf(output_format, add1(1));
    printf(output_format, add2(1, 2));
    printf(output_format, add3(1, 2, 3));
    printf(output_format, add4(1, 2, 3, 4));
    printf(output_format, add5(1, 2, 3, 4, 5));
    printf(output_format, add6(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6));
    printf(output_format, add7(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7));
    printf(output_format, add8(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8));
    printf(output_format, add9(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9));
    printf(output_format, add10(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10));

    return 0;
}
```

## Homework Problem #16: "Change Return Address"

Write two programs in x86-64 and aarch64 assembly that get one C
String argument from `argv` with a path to an executable (e.g., `/bin/yes`),
and overwrite the return address in such a way, that instead of returning to
`libc_start_main` runtime function from `main`, the programs return to a
function `system` which starts the specified program from the argument. Read
more about the `system` function with the help of `man`. Think where to put
arguments so that function `system` can start the specified program.

```bash
gcc (and aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc) -static -fno-pie -no-pie -o 15 15.x86-64.s
echo $$ 
588728 # could be any other process ID of the shell
./15
$ echo $$
590642 # could be any other process ID, but it should not be equal to the one above
```
